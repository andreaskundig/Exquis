* bootstrap mechanism

** main.js calls net.loadAnimations with exquis.init as argument
net.loadAnimations(x, init) 
net.loadAssemblage(x, assName, init)
*** gets assemblage json (2d array of names)
*** net.loadJsons2d(animNames : creates jsonAnimations
**** returns 2d array of Animation.json where {animation: { setup: string, draw:string}, name: string} 
*** init(x, assName, jsonAnimations: 2dArray of Animation.json)
  
** init creates attributes of the global exquis (x) object
*** cells
*** animate


exquis.init is called with all the loaded animations as argument
exquis.init creates an exquis object and calls makeEditor(exquis)

* ev.loadJsAnimOnCanvasAnim DELETED
loads animationCode from uri with requirejs
sets canvasAnim.animationName 
TODO compute the animation name from the url instead of taking an argument 
** evileval.evalAnimation DELETED
converts codeString to data uri
TODO converting the codeString to data uri is now the job of canvasAnim.setCodeString
delete this method
*** exquis.canvasAnim.addCodeStringToEvaluate
creates an evaluateCode method to be called at the next iteration
**** editorController.textAreaController.onCodeChange
you have typed something
TODO the editor should know CanvasAnim, but should not access exquis. 
canvasAnim is given to the editor by editorController.loadCodeString(canvasAnim)

**** exquis.canvasAnim.getSourceCodeString
returns the code as a string in whatever original language it was written in
reads it from its own cache if present (use a data uri)
or else loads it from the store with originalUrl and calls setCodeString

***** editorController.textAreaController.updateWithCanvasAnim (if ! match data:)
- loads the code as text (codeString) from the url TODO put this in canvasAnim.getSourceCodeString
- puts the codeString in the editor

******* DONE give the canvasAnim object to the editor.
******** DONE the editor calls canvasAnim.getCodeString, 

******* DONE a new component: the store
different implementations of the store would save the animation in different places.
The original url of the animation is independent of the store
because we want exquis to be able to just display animations from any url.
The store needs to know where to save an animation based on its url.
Currently the original url is replaced by a data uri when it is first edited,
because it's only used to load the code. We need to keep it in order to save it.

******* DONE canvasAnim.originalUrl .codeUri
originalUrl is the address from where the animation is first loaded
codeUri is a data uri that contains the code being edited
 
****** editorController...load...pickanimation
you click the button to load a new animation
DONE pickanimation is no longer on the editor, we're moving that button 
** net.loadAssemblage
*** net.findAndLoadAssemblage
**** main

* blockly
Blockly code is something else than javascript, xml I think.
We want a blockly animation editor that generates javascript and gives it to the canvas anim
The xml of the currently edited animation should be stored somewhere when we edit another animation
When we want to save the xml it should be persisted by the store.
When exquis loads an xml animation, it asks a blockly object to translate it.
The type of code could be specified in a comment at the beginning of the file, or in any other way 
<!--blockly--> ;clojure
